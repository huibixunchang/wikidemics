NOTE: RSync is just a file transfer utility.
    -Wikipeida doesn't support rsync, so have to use mirrors

NOTE: Wikimedia access logs vs dumps
        -Dumps are the actual wikipeida pages, stored as XML files
        -Access logs allows one to see how many people have visited an article during a given time period.
            * Do not reflect unique visitors, just how many times the page has been requested.
