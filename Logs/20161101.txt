NOTE: RSync is just a file transfer utility.
    -Wikipeida doesn't support rsync, so have to use mirrors

NOTE: Wikimedia access logs vs dumps
        -Dumps are the actual wikipeida pages, stored as XML files
        -Access logs allows one to see how many people have visited an article during a given time period.
            * Do not reflect unique visitors, just how many times the page has been requested.
NOTE: PageCounts
        -pagecounts-raw, and pagecounts-all-sites dataset generation stopped on 2016-08-05, see
        https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/analytics/2016-August/005339.html
        - new page view set is located here,
        https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pageviews/

PageviewAPI
    -Since the end of 2015, Wikimedia has supported the new pageviews API, maybe consider using this instead?



Creating .cfg file to load access-logs onto my harddrive

NOTE: "/raw" is appened to `access_log_dir`

Started collecting data into
    /media/william/passport/AccessLogs/Raw
Using rsync mirror
